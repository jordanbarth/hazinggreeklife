Cease and Desist: If an investigation is being conducted or a hearing with the Committee on Student Life (CSL) is pending, a chapter may be put on a temporary Cease and Desist status. Cease and desist orders require the chapter to temporarily stop all activity, including but not limited to individual initiated member/new member gatherings, recruitment events, social events, and new member meetings. Any necessary fraternity business meetings may be pre-approved by the OFSL.
Disciplinary Probation: An organization is not in good standing with the University after having been found responsible for serious violations of University policy or subsequent violations after prior disciplinary action. This may be determined by a hearing through the IGC Judiciary or the CSL. Violations of the terms of Disciplinary Probation, which are specified in the chapter?s outcome letter, or any new violations of University policy while the chapter is on probation may result in the revocation of the organization?s recognition.  Organizations on disciplinary probation are permitted to conduct operations as usual unless additional modifications to operating status are made in the chapter outcome letter.
Social Probation: The organization is unable to host social events with alcohol. During social probation, chapters are not permitted to coordinate and/or hold social events with alcohol. This includes social functions with alcohol in the chapter house, brothers? homes, or third party venues. Social probation has no limit to minimum or maximum duration. Recruitment, new member education, educational events, and philanthropy events are allowed during social probation.
Suspension: The organization?s recognition is suspended by the University for a specified period of time. The suspension may be deferred provided that the organization complete the requirements outlined from a disciplinary hearing. Further violations could result in the permanent revocation of the organization?s University recognition.
